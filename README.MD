Forum Roleplaying Games-like System is a user-friendly application that offers dynamic gameplay in [play-by-post fashion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-post_role-playing_game).

# Features:
- [ ] Reading others' threads
- [ ] Posting your own threads
- [ ] Private messages
- [ ] Formatting and searching systems
- [ ] Notification manager
- [ ] Fast server switching
- [ ] Full roleplay mode - user can interact only with GM and nearby players

## Notifications
Our program is intended to be as lightweight as possible. 

Its purpose is to keep the user authenticated in order to notify if there is: 
- a new thread pinned to player by Game Master
- a new private message inbox
- a new response to user's thread or private message

Notifications come in subtle sound and (depending on the platform) a message near the taskbar

## Documentation
Full documentation can be found on our [wiki](https://thereisnoteam.github.io/FRGIS/) or under [docs folder](https://github.com/ThereIsNoTeam/FRGIS/tree/master/docs).

## Building
You can build the porgram by yourself, to keep it simple download [project files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-MGpOfN18ijYjVRemkxTlE4dzQ?usp=sharing) and drop them into src/

## Troubleshooting
If you have witnessed an error you can send it through our ExceptionCatcher (should show up when one occurs) or write in on the project's issue page.

## Contribution
Once someone decides to help us with the project, we will review their code on a pull request and consider pushing it to the master branch.

As our team is currently made from only 3 active persons, we wouldn't mind new pairs of hands in our organization. Even those who are not intrested in this project may propose their own ideas and in time we get this one done, maybe TINTeam will be willing to focus on that idea.
